The Cyclone Dynamics project involved a comprehensive analysis of retail performance data to uncover actionable insights for business optimization. My primary responsibility was to clean, process, and analyze this data to identify trends, evaluate product performance, and assess customer behavior across different demographics and time periods (2020â€“2022). Key tasks included calculating return rates by product and category, analyzing revenue trends over time, and segmenting customer data by age group and continent.
